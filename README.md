### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stephan, a professional web developer from Cologne, Germany. My focus is on CSS and JavaScript, but my code speaks many languages.

As an open source enthusiast and agile advocate, I've worked as a freelaancer as well as full-time for small businesses and international corporations and gathered 15+ years of professional experience.
